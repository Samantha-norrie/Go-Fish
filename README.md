# go_fish
A command-line playable Go Fish game for 2-6 players! 

I was inspired to make this game after using ArrayList to make a functioning deck that could be shuffled and drawn from in my first Foundations of Programming class. After learning more skills throughout the year, I decided to use this same concept, except now with a Queue instead of an ArrayList for the deck, and to craft playable game to test my limits.
